    summary: UC Santa Cruz is a public university like no other in California. I am spending here my last academic semester in the Computer Science department as an exchange student.
    description: With my studies in the CS deparment of UCSC, I aim to specialize in the Robotics applicative field by learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I also take the opportunity to learn about specific topics that could somewhat be related to Robotics, about general culture in Computer Science and about working in an international environment with people from different cultures with different skills.

    summary: ENSEIRB-MATMECA is a public French Grande Ecole training engineers to take up the major challenges of the 21st century. I enrolled here in the Computer Science department.
    description: The main objectives of the Computer Science department are to teach theoretical and technical foundations of computing, thus enabling its students to take part in project management and IT in the corporate world. At the end of their studies, the students dispose all the necessary skills for Software Development and have basis about some specific topics. I chose to study Information Theory, Distributed Systems, Security of Information Systems, Quantum Information and Robotics.

    summary: The Lycée Lakanal is a French Higher School Preparatory Classes where I spent two very intensive years studying principally Mathematics and Physics.
    description: The Preparatory Schools exist only in France and prepare their student to pass national contest to enter the very selective public Engineering Schools. The courses offered are very general but mainly focusing on Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Science. At the end of this school, I passed several national contests, I was ranked 954/5000 for the CCP and I was eligible for the Concours Mines-Ponts.
