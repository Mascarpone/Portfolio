  - name: Camera Pose Estimation
    date: Jun 2016 - Sept 2016
    context: Following the program of the ENSEIRB-MATMECA, I spent a 3-month internship in the HyperVision Research Laboratory of Professor Saito Hideo at Keio University, Tokyo. The main objective of this internship was to discover the environment of a research laboratory while working on a specific subject about Computer Vision and Augmented-Mixed Reality.
    subject: | 
             Some applications of augmented or mixed reality find their basis in a network of cameras. The relative position estimation of the captured images is therefore needed to compute these kind of algorithms.
             The main idea which solves this problem is to determine some keypoints on each frame and to match the same keypoints on the different cameras images. Then, the epipolar geometry theory is able to give the transformation between the different frames, which consists in a rotation and a translation.
             However, if the cameras vision do not have any shared area or cannot find the same keypoints on their frames, this extrinsic calibration becomes impossible with these parameters. Shogo Miyata explains in his paper how the use of an additional omnidirectional camera can accurately solve this issue at a low price.
             My work consisted in improving Miyata's work, implementing the theory and adding Automatic Feature Detection to the final program.

  - name: Portfolio
    date: Jul 2016 - Aug 2016
    context: In order to obtain my ENSEIRB-MATMECA diploma, a 6-month intership in a company is required at the end of the studies. Afterwards, I will be looking for a job. Thus, I wanted to present my working profile with an original media that fits to who I am, and a portfolio was the ideal solution.   
    subject: |
             The objective was to show my working profile with a design that I like and some of my drawings because it describes well who I am.
             The website media gives me the opportunity to give more information about my education and the project I did than a CV.
             Working on this website was also the opportunity to learn more about some web languages and technologies. 
             For instance, I chose to use the Flask framework in Python, to add some effects with jQuery, to add the Google reCaptcha to the contact form etc.

    date: Apr 2016 - May 2016 
    context: To complete the Operating System lectures I followed at the ENSEIRB-MATMECA, this project had the goal to make me manipulate system calls and understand a file system by using fuse.
    subject: |
             The goal was to develop a file system allowing to organize files (such as images or musics) by tags.
             Using fuse, we could mount this file system on a specific directory that contains a .tags hidden file containing the database matching the files to their tags.
             In the virtual file system, all the files are accessible in the root folder and every directory is a tag containing all the files that have this tag and all the directories corresponding to the other tags of these files.
             For example, if the image toto.jpg has the tags foo and bar, then in the root folder you find the file toto.jpg and the folders foo and bar. In the foo folder you will find the file toto.jpg and the folder bar ... 
             The usual bash commands allow the user to modify the tree structure of the system.
             Moreover, several extensions could be implemented. In particular, I chose to provide a new system call handled with ioctl to print in the standard output the tags of the specified file. 
             I also added the detection of the modifications in the source folder in order to adapt the virtual file system in real time (this uses inotify and needed to be used with a fork in the program).

    date: Apr 2016 - May 2016 
    context: To complete the Network lectures at the ENSEIRB-MATMECA, the Computer Science students were asked to program a centralized Peer2Peer system in C and an oriented object language. My group and I decided to implement the Tracker in C and the Peers in C++.    
    subject: |
             In addition to the Peers, a Tracker known by all the clients had to be implemented. 
             Following a simple protocole, the Tracker can help the Peers to find seeds and leeches in the network. Since a Peer knows where to download its missing file segments, it follows another simple protocole between Peers. 
             Thus, this project focused on training us about using Sockets and Threads, following a strict protocole, manipulating a file system and working with a group of six members.

  - name: C Exercises Online
    date: Oct 2015 - May 2016
    context: This project's purpose was to make my group understand the full process of a Software Engineering project. During a bit more than six months, we experienced the SCRUM method from the conception to the realisation of a real client's project.
    subject: |
             Our client was a Computer Science Professor wanting to provide his students an online platform in order to practice what they learn about the C programming language by doing some exercises.
             The teacher had already implemented the structure and content of the website though it was only a presentation of the exercises instructions. Therefore, he wanted to add some features to improve his website.
             The main goal was to allow the user to solve the exercises online instead of on his own computer in order that he focuses only on the programming language.
             We had also to improve the design of the website, to clear the code for future developers, to make the website administration easier, write good documentation and make presentations about our work. 
             In order to achieve our objectives we had to understand the previous code, the web languages we did not know and how an exercises could be compiled and run on the server by using Docker.

    context: This project was one of the suggested projects to Computer Science students at ENSEIRB-MATMECA to evaluate them about their knowledge on DBMS. In addition, the user interface was evaluated for the first time in this school so it was the opportuniy to learn this topic by ourselves and have fun about it.
    subject: |
             In this Database Management System project, we are invited to create a database to manage a recipe site for ENSEIRB-MATMECA students. 
             The objective is to implement, on a practical case, the concepts and methods seen in the DBMS module.
             The project starts with data modeling and results in the creation of a relational database and the implementation of a certain number of transactions (consultations, updates, ranking, etc.).
             My group and I decided to offer an entire recipe website as the one you can find recently on the web. We used the Flask microframework and the MySQL DBMS.
